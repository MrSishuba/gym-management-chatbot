# gym-management-chatbot:
This is the chatbot I created it mainly was created to answer basic questions that are related to the gym be it business information or miscellaneous. This was created late on in the project and due to time it does have notable limitations such as  not handlling gibberish or information it has not be trained to respond to and as a result the chatbot stops working if such context is given to it. The backend needs to be run again to reset the chatbot and so there is quite a drawbac if not used as intended which is more the on myself for not further doing so. However it does visually  resonate and capture the essence of what I felt a sutaibale and simple online helper would be with a substantial amount of essetial and genral infoarmtation having adequate responses to as its desigend tonly to convey inforamtion on the gym and business alone, all in all it does fufill its purpose but does have room for improvment.

Setup: 
Open terminal and ran command: rasa run actions (wait for the command to finish configuring)
